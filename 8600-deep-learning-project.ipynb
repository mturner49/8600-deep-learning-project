       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.</td>\n",

Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.</td>\n",

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"   \n",

and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.  Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.  \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"  \n",

         The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.</td>\n",

       "      <td>New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.</td>\n",

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\" \n",

and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.  Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.\n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"\n",

         The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone. Photos: The robots running our warehouses Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require. Scroll through to see more robots that are revolutionizing warehouses.Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesIn response to the coronavirus pandemic, MIT collaborated with Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank to design a robot that can use UV light to sanitize the floor of a 4,000-square foot warehouse in just 30 minutes.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone.

were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating

The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday.

The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it is still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Do not invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It is always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They are not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it is a moot point. But it is also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It is a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by Lu says that have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone It doesn t get distracted   \n",

over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury Now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain The Ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks Its developer Bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by The Swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body typically increasing strength and endurance Most have a rigid structure but the Ironhand is soft like a regular glove Photos The

China ahead of the annual Singles Day online shopping bonanza in Hide Caption of Reducing fatigue When you have the glove on it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system   \n",

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal

anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement CNN s Rob North contributed to this article   "

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.</td>\n",

And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"</td>\n",

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it is still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Do not invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It is always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They are not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it is a moot point. But it is also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It is a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by Lu says that have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone It doesn t get distracted    \n",

over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury Now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain The Ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks Its developer Bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by The Swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body typically increasing strength and endurance Most have a rigid structure but the Ironhand is soft like a regular glove Photos The

China ahead of the annual Singles Day online shopping bonanza in Hide Caption of Reducing fatigue When you have the glove on it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system    \n",

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal

differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS

managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in There has been more anxiety    \n",

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and

       "0  [ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024., Photos: The

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

vehicles, including passenger cars., TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark., Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't

warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury., Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks., Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%., The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\", Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance., Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove., Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses., At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders., When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.,

boxes weighing over 30 pounds., Hide Caption 4 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesStretch is the latest robot from Boston Dynamics and can work in warehouses and distribution centers., Designed to keep human workers out of harm's way, Stretch's tentacle-like grippers mean it can manipulate boxes., Hide Caption 5 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesAlthough not specifically designed for warehouses, Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot \"Spot\" can lift objects, pick itself up after a fall, open and walk through doors, and even remind people to practice social distancing.,

objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director., \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run., \"The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove., There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object., A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275)., The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries., According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor., NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space., The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry., Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers., Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team., \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\", Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants., He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into., According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030., \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski.,

Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together., \"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\", Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted., And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon., Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next., \"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds., With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually., \"The name of the game will be differentiation., Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said., \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example., They're not.\", Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider., \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again?, If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point., But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea., The BRICS could become the TICKS., He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia., You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets., \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine., So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves., \"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks., It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro., \"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014., \"There has been more anxiety.\"]   \n",

include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich., The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU., \"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry., Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday., It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion., The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur., The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership., \"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect., These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

A \"Flying-V\" plane designed by Delft's University of Technology in the Netherlands and Dutch airline KLM can cut fuel consumption by 20%. Ultimately, researchers hope to switch out the kerosene with a sustainable fuel source, like liquid hydrogen.Hide Caption 7 of 13 Photos: Hydrogen aviation could provide a sustainable solution for short and medium-haul flights. In September, Airbus unveiled plans for three hydrogen-powered, zero-emission aircraft which can carry 100 to 200 passengers. It hopes to launch the first ZEROe aircraft in 2035.Hide Caption 8 of 13 Photos: In December 2019, Canadian airline Harbour Air flew the world's first all-electric, zero-emission commercial aircraft.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human

The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it is still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Do not invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It is always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They are not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it is a moot point. But it is also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It is a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by Lu says that have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone It doesn t get distracted    \n",

over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury Now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain The Ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks Its developer Bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by The Swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body typically increasing strength and endurance Most have a rigid structure but the Ironhand is soft like a regular glove Photos The

China ahead of the annual Singles Day online shopping bonanza in Hide Caption of Reducing fatigue When you have the glove on it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system    \n",

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal Campos head of investing at Betterment For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets Winograd said each country should be looked at individually The name of the game will be differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS

managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in There has been more anxiety    \n",

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and

       "0  [ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024., Photos: The

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

vehicles, including passenger cars., TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark., Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't

warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury., Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks., Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%., The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\", Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance., Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove., Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses., At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders., When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.,

boxes weighing over 30 pounds., Hide Caption 4 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesStretch is the latest robot from Boston Dynamics and can work in warehouses and distribution centers., Designed to keep human workers out of harm's way, Stretch's tentacle-like grippers mean it can manipulate boxes., Hide Caption 5 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesAlthough not specifically designed for warehouses, Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot \"Spot\" can lift objects, pick itself up after a fall, open and walk through doors, and even remind people to practice social distancing.,

objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director., \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run., \"The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove., There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object., A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275)., The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries., According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor., NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space., The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry., Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers., Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team., \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\", Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants., He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into., According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030., \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski.,

Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together., \"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\", Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted., And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon., Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next., \"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds., With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually., \"The name of the game will be differentiation., Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said., \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example., They're not.\", Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider., \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again?, If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point., But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea., The BRICS could become the TICKS., He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia., You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets., \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine., So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves., \"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks., It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro., \"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014., \"There has been more anxiety.\"]   \n",

include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich., The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU., \"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry., Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday., It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion., The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur., The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership., \"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect., These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024. Photos: The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the world's first zero-emission, autonomous cargo ship. The ship is scheduled to make its first journey between two Norwegian towns before the end of the year.

Cities around the world are adopting electric ferries. Norwegian startup Zeabuz hopes its self-driving electric ferry (pictured here as a rendering) will help revive urban waterways.Hide Caption 3 of 13 Photos: In China, a new Maglev high-speed train rolls off the production line in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province, on July 20. It has a top speed of 600 km per hour -- currently the fastest ground vehicle available globally. Hide Caption 4 of 13 Photos: Reaching speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) per hour, Hyperloop could be a sustainable replacement to short-haul flights. Dutch company Hardt (shown here as a rendering) started work on its Hyperloop test facility in Europe, anticipated to open in 2022.Hide Caption 5 of 13 Photos: Hyperloop is like a bullet train, without tracks and rails. Floating pods are propelled through a low-pressure steel tube using magnetic levitation. Virgin has been running tests with passengers on its XP-2 vehicle, pictured here.Hide Caption 6 of 13 Photos: Low carbon travel isn't just about switching to sustainable fuel sources -- it's also about redesigning the transport itself. A \"Flying-V\" plane designed by Delft's University of Technology in the Netherlands and Dutch airline KLM can cut fuel consumption by 20%. Ultimately, researchers hope to switch out the kerosene with a sustainable fuel source, like liquid hydrogen.Hide Caption 7 of 13 Photos: Hydrogen aviation could provide a sustainable solution for short and medium-haul flights.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone.

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space.

Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.</td>\n",

The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it is still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Do not invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It is always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They are not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it is a moot point. But it is also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks.

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the world s first zero emission autonomous cargo ship The ship is scheduled to make its first journey between two Norwegian towns before the end of the year Click through to see more forms of transport

Technology in the Netherlands and Dutch airline KLM can cut fuel consumption by Ultimately researchers hope to switch out the kerosene with a sustainable fuel source like liquid hydrogen Hide Caption

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired

says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal Campos head of investing at Betterment For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets Winograd said each country should be looked at individually The name of the game will be differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST To stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS and that could be a permanent change said Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in There has been more anxiety    \n",

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and

       "0  [ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024., Photos: The

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

vehicles, including passenger cars., TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark., Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone., It doesn't get distracted.\"]   \n",

warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury., Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks., Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%., The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\", Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance., Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove., Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses., At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders., When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.,

objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director., \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run., \"The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove., There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object., A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275)., The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries., According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor., NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space., The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry., Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers., Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team., \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\", Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants., He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into., According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030., \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski., \"But this is an exciting technology., \"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.]   \n",

Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together., \"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\", Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted., And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon., Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next., \"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds., With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually., \"The name of the game will be differentiation., Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said., \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example., They're not.\", Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider., \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again?, If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point., But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea., The BRICS could become the TICKS., He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia., You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets., \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine., So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves., \"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks., It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro., \"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014., \"There has been more anxiety.\"]   \n",

include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich., The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU., \"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry., Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday., It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion., The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur., The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership., \"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect., These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>[ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.,

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds.

It is a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the world s first zero emission autonomous cargo ship The ship is scheduled to make its first journey between two Norwegian towns before the end of the year Click through to see more forms of transport set to transform the future Hide Caption of Photos Pictured here as a rendering Oceanbird is a wind powered transatlantic car carrier that cuts carbon emissions by compared to a standard car carrier Hide Caption of Photos It s not just maritime ships that are going green Cities around the world are adopting electric ferries Norwegian startup Zeabuz hopes its self driving electric ferry pictured

has a top speed of km per hour currently the fastest ground vehicle available globally Hide Caption of Photos Reaching speeds of up to kilometers miles per hour Hyperloop could be a sustainable

Technology in the Netherlands and Dutch airline KLM can cut fuel consumption by Ultimately researchers hope to switch out the kerosene with a sustainable fuel source like liquid hydrogen Hide Caption

to passengers It hopes to launch the first ZEROe aircraft in Hide Caption of Photos In December Canadian airline Harbour Air flew the world s first all electric zero emission commercial aircraft The six seater seaplane was retrofitted with magniX s magni all electric motor Harbour Air which carries half a million passengers annually hopes to become the world s first all electric airline Hide

allowing them to go further with less effort E bikes are now even available on ride share apps like Uber Hide Caption of Photos While sleeper trains or buses might be the way most of us get some shut

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by Lu says that have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired

says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries

Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system    \n",

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal Campos head of investing at Betterment For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets Winograd said each country should be looked at individually The name of the game will be differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST To stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS and that could be a permanent change said Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in There has been more anxiety    \n",

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and

       "0  [ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024., Photos: The

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

vehicles, including passenger cars., TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark., Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone., It doesn't get distracted.\"]   \n",

warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury., Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks., Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%., The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\", Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance., Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove., Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses., At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders., When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.,

objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director., \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run., \"The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove., There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object., A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275)., The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries., According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor., NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space., The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry., Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers., Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team., \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\", Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants., He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into., According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030., \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski., \"But this is an exciting technology., \"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.]   \n",

Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together., \"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\", Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted., And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon., Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next., \"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds., With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually., \"The name of the game will be differentiation., Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said., \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example., They're not.\", Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider., \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again?, If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point., But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea., The BRICS could become the TICKS., He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia., You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets., \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine., So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves., \"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks., It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro., \"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014., \"There has been more anxiety.\"]   \n",

include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich., The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU., \"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry., Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday., It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion., The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur., The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership., \"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect., These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's

       "      <td>(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n",

The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.</td>\n",

       "0   (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n",

over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                            New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

        The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.    \n",

       "0  (CNN)Right now, there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we are testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver was not touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck does not need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks will not be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that is still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you are adding five cents per mile. But you are saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat does not mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that is not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that is a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it is more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers do not want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They are not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck does not get tired, does not watch a movie or look at a phone. It does not get distracted.\"   \n",

the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they do not have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove. Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually because a medical concern for that individual operator.\" Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it is not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n",

They are not just working hard, they are working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they are guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

                                        New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it is not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it is still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Do not invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It is always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They are not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it is a moot point. But it is also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It is a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n",

                             The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.\"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion. The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur. The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership.\"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect. These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's Rob North contributed to this article.   \n",

       "0   CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in TuSimple has completed about million miles of road tests with its prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and build fully autonomous models which it hopes to launch by Photos The Yara Birkeland is what its builders call the

service in Austria Hide Caption of No sleepTuSimple s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce miles from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in hours versus the usual with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US of goods travel through just of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take and divide it by million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about to per year or cents to per mile Today the direct labor cost is about of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by Lu says that have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our

those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone It doesn t get distracted    \n",

over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury Now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain The Ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks Its developer Bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by The Swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body typically increasing strength and endurance Most have a rigid structure but the Ironhand is soft like a regular glove Photos The

China ahead of the annual Singles Day online shopping bonanza in Hide Caption of Reducing fatigue When you have the glove on it provides strength and reduces the effort needed when lifting objects says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from million in to billion in If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system    \n",

called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal

differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS

managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in There has been more anxiety    \n",

                                                            The European Union formally approved on Tuesday a new barrage of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine which include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia The sanctions which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included a far reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU The measure will hit Russia s oil majors Rosneft Transneft and Gazprom Neft GZPFY but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them an EU source told Reuters There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin s military industrial complex the EU executive said Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect billion euros billion worth of products the Commission said EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than euros including jewelry Exports of cars costing more than euros will also be banned EU sources said The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its most favored nation trade status opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans UK slaps tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than billion The additional tariff will be applied to imports including vodka steel works of art and fur The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade ensuring it does not benefit from the rules based international system it does not respect These tariffs build on the UK s existing work to starve Russia s access to international finance sanction Putin s cronies and

       "0  [ (CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic., One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one., Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe., Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024., Photos: The

hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City., The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself., Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO., The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep., \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day., We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu., That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard., Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software., \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route., That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu., As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else., This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business., TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024., Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads., Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000., According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver., \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile., But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile., Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said., Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu., By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs., \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for., We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu., TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving., \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive., A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours., But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do., That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year., The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024., Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone., Photos: The robots running our

vehicles, including passenger cars., TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark., Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track., \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking., They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks., These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said., Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits., The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night., \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu., \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone., It doesn't get distracted.\"]   \n",

warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury., Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks., Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%., The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\", Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance., Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove., Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses., At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders., When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.,

objects,\" says Mikael Wester, Bioservo's marketing director., \"It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run., \"The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove., There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object., A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275)., The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries., According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor., NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space., The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry., Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers., Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team., \"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\", Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants., He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into., According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030., \"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski.,

Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together., \"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\", Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted., And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon., Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next., \"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds., With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually., \"The name of the game will be differentiation., Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said., \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example., They're not.\", Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider., \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again?, If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point., But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea., The BRICS could become the TICKS., He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia., You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets., \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland — is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine., So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves., \"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks., It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro., \"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014., \"There has been more anxiety.\"]   \n",

include bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.The sanctions, which come into effect after publication in the EU official journal later on Tuesday, also freeze the assets of more business leaders who support the Russian state, including Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich., The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included \"a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU., \"The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry., Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its \"most-favored nation\" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday., It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion., The additional 35% tariff will be applied to imports including vodka, steel, works of art and fur., The United Kingdom will also deny Russia and Belarus access to its most favoured nation trading tariff for hundreds of their exports, effectively depriving both countries of key benefits of their WTO membership., \"Our new tariffs will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, ensuring it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect., These tariffs build on the UK's existing work to starve Russia's access to international finance, sanction Putin's cronies and exert maximum economic pressure on his regime,\" finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement.— CNN's
